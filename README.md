# Sheriff Voice Manager 🤠

A powerful Discord bot that allows users to create and manage temporary voice channels with ease. Sheriff gives channel owners the ability to manage their voice channels without needing administrator privileges.

## Features ✨

- **Automatic Voice Channels**: Users can create their own temporary voice channels by joining a specially designated voice channel
- **Owner Controls**: Channel owners can:

  - 🔊 Set user limits
  - 👢 Kick unwanted users
  - 🚫 Ban problematic users
  - ✅ Unban users
  - 👑 Transfer channel ownership

- **Permissions Management**: Sheriff automatically handles all permission settings - no need to give users roles
- **Nitro Booster Perks**: Server boosters get higher channel limits

## Setup Guide 🚀

1. **Invite the Bot**:

   - Invite Sheriff to your Discord server using the provided invite link

2. **Server Configuration**:

   - When Sheriff joins your server, it will create a private "sheriff-onboarding" channel visible only to administrators
   - Follow the guided setup process to configure:
     - Category name for voice channels
     - Creator channel name (the channel users join to create their own)
     - Channel naming format
     - User limits for regular users and Nitro Boosters

3. **How It Works**:
   - Users join the creator voice channel
   - They're automatically moved to their own new voice channel
   - As the channel owner, they can use Sheriff's commands to manage their channel
